1. Eager loading :

public static DbConnection createInstance(){
       if(instance == null){ return new DbConnection(); }
       return instance;
}

In the above code, we have if(instance == null), if multiple threads pass on to that condition at the same time before creating object , it will pass null check & creates additional objects which is against singleton rule.
we can sort this by eager loading

private static DbConnection dbc = new DbConnection(), while compiling itself object will be created. Refer DbConnectionEagerLoading codebase

Cons :
- Application start time will increase if we use eager loading
- But here we can't pass any arguments.

2. Using Synchronized keyword:

Cons :
- What if it has already created object , when next thread goes it locks the code again ; null checks & rejects
- Slows down the entire process.

We need to lock only the critical section for better performance.

3. Using Double checked locking :
- Proper way of implementing Singleton without any issues.
- We are introducing double checked locking to make sure not more than 1 thread enters critical section
- Refer DbConnectionLock class
