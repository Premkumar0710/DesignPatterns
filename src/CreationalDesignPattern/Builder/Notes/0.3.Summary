WHEN TO USE BUILDER ?
- Whenever we have class with lot of attributes
- When we need to validate the attributes before object creation
- Immutable (All the params needs to be passed at the time of object creation)

SUMMARY
- Student -> getBuilder -> Builder -> setId , setName etc.. (returns builder) -> build(which returns Student)
